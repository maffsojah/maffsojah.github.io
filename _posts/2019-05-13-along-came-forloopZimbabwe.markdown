## A new chapter from Southern Africa

Building a culture of community, learning to listen to each other, sharing knowledge and building together. A lot can be learnt from a group of people who have a hunger for knowledge, zeal for success and an appetite to represent the best of what can be.

Welcome to **_[forloopZimbabwe!!](https://forloopzim.co.zw)_**

## Meet, Share, Collaborate

Meet, Share, Collaborate grew from being a mere theme at the Maiden event of #forloopZimbabwe to becoming a code, a value, and a worthy cause in the Zimbabwean tech scene. It started with numerous discussions about the growth of Zim tech communities, the issues they have faced over the years and what solutions are available to fix these issues.

Meeting(remotely or physically), Sharing(advice, knowledge, resources, even contacts) and Collaborating(building solutions, teaching other people). These became the core values of a growing community for #forloopZimbabwe. As a first event, the theme had to be inclusive, not too technical, and relating to the core values and goals of [forloopAfrica](https://forloop.africa/).

If anyone had foretold the whole experience of organising the #forloopZimbabwe maiden event, I don’t think I would have agreed 😅. This experience became the most stressful and exciting thing I’ve done in 2019. The idea of getting many people together, networking, getting a venue, food among other things seemed like an impossible task until the day of the launch. It was a one-day event with 5 talks, unfortunately **Olivier J.M** the 6th speaker from forloopZambia couldn’t make it to the event.

Our speakers were from different fields of technology and this is what made their sessions interesting. Each talk had a Q&A session and a 15-minute break for networking because the main goal of the event was to meet different people who attended and find a common ground.

## The speakers

#### Brighton Mukorera -- "From the old to blockchain"

## the AfternoonShow

This was an afternoon session for networking, asking questions and understanding the values that brought about the forloopAfrica community. This session had Prosper leading the discussion, answering different questions from the crowd while talking about the roots of forloopAfrica and what lies ahead for the community.

He received various questions ranging from his skillset, forloopAfrica, women in tech, remote working and the crowd’s favorite comparison between Nigerian and Ghanain jollof(there is video evidence) 😂. He even went further to compare Nigerian jollof to Laravel code because of it’s presentation.
We also received some questions from those who were live-streaming the event on Twitter.

## what's next?

The maiden event showed how much people love to work as a community, how curious people are when it comes to development’s best practices and their willingness to share and learn from each other. #forloopZimbabwe aims to put the Zimbabwean tech community on the world map while also collaborating with other forloopAfrica chapters in different countries. We believe we can grow from learning and also teaching others. This will be done through more events, bootcamps or hackathons.
