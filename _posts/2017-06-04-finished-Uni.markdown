## Now that I have finished Uni:

On Friday the 2nd of June I wrote my final exam and this marked the end of my Final year. I couldn't help but notice my colleagues and classmates being cheerful and all full of excitement. Well...that wasn't me at all, I mean I wasn't excited as they were. It's not that I wasn't relieved that I had come to the end of my final year but rather it felt like a beginning to me.  

A beginning to a whole new stage, a whole new life, a whole new adventure, a journey full of ups and downs. There is a saying we always say here in Zimbabwe, it's rather our own inside joke tbh.  
> It's that time of year again, when final year students have finished their final exams. It's that time of the year, where the country has yet again added another 3000+ unemployed students to the streets.  

It's not funny really but it's the truth. Plus that's not really how it is said but I had to translate and add some sense to it.  

#### why am I not excited? Did I really like school that much?  
No, I didn't like school at all. I am not excited because I wasn't relieved by finishing varsity. I do not really think anything ended when I finished varsity, rather it opened the very first stage of the world. I see it as a beginning, an entry of the door of adulthood and life in general. "*I'm a student, I don't have time*" has been my excuse for the past 4/5 years.  
Late into my final semester when I was finishing up my Capstone project, I decided to make plans for when I have finished school. That is the only time I was excited about finishing school and it was worth it. Always knowing what you want to do is cool but it is way too cool to be able to accomplish all that.

The following is an extract from my first blog post, it's kind of a reminder of who I am and what I want to achieve. So yes, I will keep on adding it averywhere.


In 2017, I will be completing or ~~I might complete~~ my first degree in Software Engineering.
I never want to let anyone know I am doing a Software Engineering degree. I always say,"<span class="evidence">I work at blah blah blah.</span>"  
Do I feel like I do not deserve that title yet? <span class="evidence">***Yes***</span>  
Why do I feel like that? <span class="evidence">***wait...***</span>  
What am I doing about it? <span class="evidence">***This is where 2017 comes into play***</span>

2017 is the year I want to start deserving the title **Developer** or **Software Engineer**. It might start with beginner or novice
 but at least I will deserve it. In the past years, I've had many excuses like;  
 - I am a student, I don't have time
 - My job takes a lot of time, I will be tired
 - This is just hard, let me sleep
 - *the classic* I will start tomorrow
 - *some times I would just not have an excuse, lol.*  

I remember when someone  made me read
[Stop being a f@#$£@g Joker]{:target="_blank"} in 2013
and all I could think about was to not become one. As much as that article enlightened me, it also became part of the procrastination. *-so sad*
Again, I read [ABC: Always Be Coding]{:target="_blank"} and yes it pushed some sense into my head.
I wanted to be a developer but I wasn't coding everyday, I wasn't reading enough and I read blog after blog trying to get the best language to learn/ master.

#### So, let me introduce myself
Me:

> Hi, I'm maffsojah. I'm joker and I don't like to be one anymore. I want to deserve the title developer and all other titles and skills I want.
I want to document my learning process on this journey.  
**I'm not a robot, I'm just like you**

Also me:

> Hi, maffsojah

*lol*

Oh, I almost forgot. 2017 has been awesome tbh, I finished varsity and my friend got married. Hahaha, I guess I was more excited about the marriage than I was about finishing school. I wish him and his wife a happy marriage.
