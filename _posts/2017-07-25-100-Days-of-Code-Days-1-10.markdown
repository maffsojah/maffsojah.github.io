## Day 1
### [1] Project Manager application using React JS
- setup project, linked with Firebase, added Projects and Todo components, getting Todos from API
- Also started contributing to some awesome project *well, not really. haven't started yet, but I'm in. I will post more about it. yaaay*  

## Day 2
### [2] Project Manager App, React
- today I decided to get back to the drawing board. I realised I had a lot to learn and since I have practised what I have learnt so far on a project, I decided to get back to reading.  
- On the *Project Manager* App I decided to start with some new layout because it was just plain old JSX without any styles  
- I got to learn about Component Validation using PropTypes, Authentication and building react for production.  
- *The Open Source Project*  - I learnt a very huge lesson today, I realised I have a long way to go and I havent really grasped as much as I would expect to. I met people who were writing code I had never seen before, concepts I had never heard of before.  
- I will be good at this :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Day 3
### [3] Vanilla JS, React  
- today was a bit tricky. Besides trying to learn how I could contribute to an Open Source project, I was back at Vanilla JavaScript.  
- Most of the problems I am facing are merely caused by not fully grasping JavaScript (I intend to be a ninja though :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)  
- I also learnt how to build react projects for production and how to deploy on now.sh, Github Pages and Apache server.  
- I was a bit tired today, didn't feel like doing any coding. As I was writing this post, I thought about my favorite quote and I guess I will be staying up for another 3 hours.
