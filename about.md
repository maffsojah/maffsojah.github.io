<p>Hi, I am Terry. I'm not a robot, I'm just like you</p>
<p>I'm a Junior Systems Developer from Harare, Zimbabwe. I write BASIC like code during the day and learn/ write JavaScript during the night. </p>
<p>I love building communities and I co-lead one called <a href="https://forloopzim.co.zw" target="_blank">forloopZimbabwe</a>. It is a community of developers and tech enthusiasts from Zimbabwe. We meet in borrowed spaces, graciously provided by different companies and organisations. Our purpose is to provide a place where our members have a good time talking about programming, sharing their knowledge, meeting other passionate folks and helping each other grow in the field. We keep it friendly, inclusive and positive.</p>
